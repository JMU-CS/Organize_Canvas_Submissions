# Organize_Canvas_Submissions
when an instructor downloads all submissions for an assignment in canvas, they are packed into a single directory. This script, given a path with a bunch of Canvas submissions and a list of studentnames:JMUEIDs, will create directories for each person and put their related files in that directory.

Big shout-out to @ChrisMayfield for authoring this script.

# Usage

`python canvas.py PATH`
