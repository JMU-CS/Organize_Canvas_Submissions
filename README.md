# Organize_Canvas_Submissions
when an instructor downloads all submissions for an assignment in canvas, they are packed into a single directory. This script, given a path with a bunch of Canvas submissions and a list of studentnames:JMUEIDs, will create directories for each person and put their related files in that directory.

# Usage

`python canvas.py PATH`

# Credits
Big shout-out to [Chris](https://github.com/ChrisMayfield) for authoring(? or at least sharing) this script.
